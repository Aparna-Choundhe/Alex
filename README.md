- **Web and Internet Utilities:** Open Google or perform Wikipedia searches, manage browser tabs, history, bookmarks, and incognito mode, and check internet speed.  
- **System Tools and Operations:** Launch applications like Camera, Notepad, and Command Prompt, take screenshots, display system stats (IP address, battery percentage, temperature), lock the screen, and shut down the system.  
- **Productivity Features:** Show current date and time, read PDF files aloud, and perform calculations.  
- **Communication:** Send WhatsApp messages and make video calls through WhatsApp.  

This project was built using **Python** for backend functionality and the **PyQt5 framework** to create a dynamic and interactive graphical user interface (GUI). By integrating APIs and advanced libraries, the assistant delivers a seamless and user-friendly experience.The assistant demonstrates strong proficiency in automation, GUI design, and voice command processing, making it a valuable productivity tool.
